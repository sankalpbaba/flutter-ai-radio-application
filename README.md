# flutter-ai-radio-application
I watched several tutorials to do this project.
THIS APPLICATION IS BASED ON USER EXPERIENCE.BASICALLY WE PROVIDE A USER A PLATFORM WHERE THEY CAN LISTEN LIVE RADIO FOR SOME PARTICULARE CHANNELS ADDED BY US MANUALLY , HERE THEY CAN LISTEN SONGS, LIVE DISCUSSIONS ETC OR ANYTHING GOING ON RADIO CHANNEL​
I AM USING FLUTTER AND DART LANGUAGE TO DESIGN  THIS APPLICATION​

IF WE NEED TO ADD THE POWERED VOICE FEATURE THEN WE NEED TO USE SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOICE ASSITANT WHICH WILL HELP US TO GIVE COMMANDS .​

IT IS A PLATFORM WITH NUMEROUS RADIO CHANNELS AT A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY WHICH HELP US TO LISTEN ANYTHING LIVE HAPPENING ON CHANNEL​

WE CAN SELECT ANY CHANNEL ACCORDING TO OUR INTEREST
